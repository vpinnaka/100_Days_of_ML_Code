# 100_Days_of_ML_Code
This is the repository to showcase my work for accomplishing 100DaysofMLCode

### Day 1: July 5, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I've created repository for exploring titanic data set.

**Thoughts** Earlier I was using MOOCS for learning ML, while doing assignments they have provided the sample codes which never gave me a chance to code completly from scratch. But now I came to know that I have to work on basic pandas syntax and need lot of understanding to code from scratch
