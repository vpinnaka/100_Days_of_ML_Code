# 100_Days_of_ML_Code
This is the repository to showcase my work for accomplishing 100DaysofMLCode

### Day 1: July 5, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I've created repository for exploring titanic data set.

**Thoughts** Earlier I was using MOOCS for learning ML, while doing assignments they have provided the sample codes which never gave me a chance to code completly from scratch. But now I came to know that I have to work on basic pandas syntax and need lot of understanding to code from scratch

### Day2: July 7, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I've analyzed the dataset for categorical, continious features.

**Thoughts** Analaysing each attributes is time taking if we have more number of features

### Day3: July 8, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Completed K-Means clustering videos in Udacity ML Nanodegree .

**Thoughts** K-Means clustering have limitations, the major one local minima. When the centeroids are inteitalies to local minima while picking randomly will cause failure of K-Means clustering. One way is to run K-Means algorithem multiple times and get the ensemble of all the phases. If more number of clusters are assigned the more local minimas exists.

### Day4: July 9, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Started working on K-Means clustering mini project in Udacity ML Nanodegree .

**Thoughts** K-Means clustering have limitations, the major one local minima. When the centeroids are inteitalies to local minima while picking randomly will cause failure of K-Means clustering.
